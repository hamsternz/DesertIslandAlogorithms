# Math algorithms

Things you might need to know to bootstrap your math environment

## Calculating Pi
pi/4 = 1/1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 ....

Converges very slowly, so to greatly improve accuracy, add or subtract half of the last term. 

## calculating 'e'

e = 1 + 1/(1!) + 1/(2!) + 1/(3!)...

## Square roots

Successive approximation -TBD

## trigonometric function

Use CORDIC for SIN, COS and ATAN

## Exponentiation & Logarithms

Iterative approximation - TBD
